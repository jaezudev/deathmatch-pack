# Deathmatch Pack
Ever wanted a way to quickly deploy DOOM? Probably not. But here you go.

This project was born out of a desire to play multiplayer games on my school network and have a quick way of deploying stuff. **DOWNLOAD IT NOW**

This pack uses FreeDM, which can be downloaded from the [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io) website.
